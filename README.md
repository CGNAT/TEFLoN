*TEFLoN*
=======

TEFLoN uses illumina sequence data to discover the positions and identity of TEs present in a sample/samples.
Input data can either be individually sequenced or pooled data and multiple samples can be analyzed simultaneously to improve sensitivity.

## Dependencies

TEFLoN is only dependent on samtools if you have a TE annotation file in bed format.
If you do not have a TE annotation file in bed format TEFLoN is also dependent on RepeatMasker.
